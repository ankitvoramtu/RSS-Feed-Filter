## RSS OVERVIEW
Many websites have content that is updated on an unpredictable schedule. News sites, such as [Google News](http://news.google.com/), are a good example of this. One tedious way to keep track of this changing content is to load the website up in your browser, and periodically hit the refresh button. Fortunately, this process can be streamlined and automated by connecting to the website's RSS feed, using an RSS feed reader instead of a web browser (e.g. [Sage](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sage/)). An RSS reader will periodically collect and draw your attention to updated content. RSS stands for "Really Simple Syndication". An RSS feed consists of (periodically changing) data stored in an XML-format file residing on a web-server.
